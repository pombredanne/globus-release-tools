NAME
----
repo-s3-sync - Copy the newest packages from local cache to S3

[[repo-s3-sync-SYNOPSIS]]
SYNOPSIS
--------
*repo-s3-sync* [ -h | --help ]

*repo-s3-sync* [ OPTIONS ]

[[repo-s3-sync-DESCRIPTION]]
DESCRIPTION
-----------
The *repo-s3-sync* program assumes that another script has already been run to
create local packages in a directory identified as the *ROOT*. This may be the
*CACHE* or *ROOT* in other scripts, depending on where it is run.
Packages are copied from the *ROOT* into an S3 bucket (by default,
*s3://downloads.globus.org*)

The *repo-s3-sync* program can either copy all files in the *ROOT*, or a
specified *--subdir* of the *ROOT*.

By default, files are compared against any existing S3 data using checksums,
but you can specify *--compare-method* to tune this behavior.

To keep the process speedy, *repo-s3-sync* uses a large threadpool to
parallelize the check-and-upload tasks. You can adjust the number of threads
used with *--pool-size*

[[repo-s3-sync-OPTIONS]]
OPTIONS
-------
*-h, --help*::
    Show a help message and exit
*-r ROOT, --root ROOT*::
    Sync packages from the ROOT directory
*--subdir CACHE*::
    Subdirectory of *ROOT* to sync instead of full *ROOT*
*-d, --dryrun*::
    Display files that would be copied, but don't actually execute the copy
*--delete*::
    Do a sync-delete operation, removing files not in the source dir after
    uploading is complete. Recommend using *--verbose* with this flag
*-v, --verbose*::
    Be verbose about checks and uploads, list every file
*--s3-bucket BUCKETNAME*::
    Sync to *BUCKETNAME*, defaults to +downloads.globus.org+
*--s3-path PATH*::
    Path prefix to use in *BUCKETNAME*, defaults to +toolkit/gt6+
    Will have +data/+ prepended, as all writes to the S3 bucket go into the
    +data/+ namespace
*--compare-method METHOD*::
    How to compare files against S3. One of 'checksum', 'size', 'modified'
    (i.e. mtime vs. S3 modified time), 'nocheck'. Defaults to 'checksum'
